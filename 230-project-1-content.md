## VI. Gameplay
### Mechanics
Cardinal movement around a grid. Can only move one square at a time (Holding down up will only move you up one square)
Objstacle Avoidance. Objstacles are telegraphed on the grid before they occur
### Control
The rat moves to adjacent tiles when an arrow key is first pressed. If there is no space there, the rat will not move
### Instructions
When the game starts for the first time, a screen will appear with the arrow keys as well as images that show the player how attacks will be telegraphed 
### Player Learning
In order to beat the game, the player must know know what indicates that a specific attack is about to happen and then be able to effectively get out of the way of that attack. For Example, a tile flashing red would indicate that there's about to be an attack there and the player would move away from that tile.
